Do stocks tend to have negative returns on a Monday?

An analysis was completed for a set of stocks over the past two decades to determine if a specific day of the week would impact your returns. What if returns for a stock tend to be negative on a Monday, would you wait until Tuesday to sell?
Are there specific months or industries which this has a bigger effect for? What about positive returns, would that affect when you buy a stock?

A regression analysis on a stocks daily returns was completed for a 19 year period; an analysis seperating dates before and after the 2008 crash was also completed. Some stocks exhibited negative returns on a Monday before the 08' crash, but not after.
